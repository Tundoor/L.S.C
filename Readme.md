<h1>StudyEct</h1>
<p> This is a website that helps connect learners to the resources that they need to thrive at school. From past papers, to Pomodoro timers and even to communication channels that learners can use to connect with their peers from all over the country. And maybe even the world. </p>

<h1>My inspiration</h1>
<p>Creating a project like this was inspired by my own learning journey and of those of my sister. I noticed that some times you would spend more time on the internet, searching and trying to find the answers than you would studying. So I wanted to make to take away that hassle for all students.</p>

<h1>Areas of improvement</h1> 
<p>The website is still on it's very first version and needs lots of hardwork and polishing to get it to its final stage. But currently it perfectly encapsulates the idea I was going for and give me inspiration that with hard work and retouching on it, it will become something absolutely amazing.</p>
